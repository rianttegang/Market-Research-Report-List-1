<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Dryer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Type</li><li>Indirect Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The solar dryer market is primarily divided into two types: direct and indirect solar dryers. Direct types expose the product directly to sunlight, utilizing solar energy for drying—ideal for small-scale applications. Indirect types, however, separate the drying chamber from sunlight, using heat exchangers to transfer warmth, providing better temperature control and protection from contaminants. This segmentation caters to varying needs, with direct designs favoring cost-effectiveness and simplicity, while indirect models prioritize efficiency and quality in drying processes.</p></p>
